    "4. The model explaining 17.6% of the variability means that the R squared value is 0.176. This is not directly correlated to the statistical significance of coefficients because there are possibly other variables that impact the model which would then make the model less accurate while still holding the significance of the coefficients used. So the model likely captures significant effects from the variables used, however, it does not explain a large part of the data variability."

If there are large fluctuations then the model may be sensitive to the data used in training which can be a sign of overfitting. This also just gives us an easy way to compare how the model fits the in-sample vs out-of-sample to give a clear indication if there is overfitting."

    "These blocks of code all compare one of our created models to a more realistic version of our model where we would only get some of our data and we would need to predict future data. Our idealized model has access to half of the total dataset which will account for changes in the population over time while our realistic models cannot do this as we have not seen how the population will change in the future. It also illustrates the importance of not overfitting models as model7 does not work as well when it is predicting future data which is seen in the first 2 code blocks while the simpler model6 still works pretty well."

    "In this conversation, we worked through various steps and principles for developing and interpreting regression models, initially exploring the differences between models with and without interaction terms. We discussed how adding interaction terms, especially between continuous and binary indicator variables, influences the behavior of a regression model, altering the relationships it can capture between predictor variables and the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then applied these principles to a hypothetical example involving a company's advertising budgets, examining how TV and online ad spending might interact and affect sales outcomes. This setup required creating linear forms for models both with and without interactions and interpreting these forms to understand the impact of interaction on predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we explored model-building code with statsmodels, specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing models step-by-step (model3 through model7), examining the addition of variables and interaction terms, and observing how these affected model fit.\n",
    "Comparing \"in-sample\" and \"out-of-sample\" performance to assess generalization and detect issues like multicollinearity, particularly when using complex models with many predictors and interaction terms.\n",
    "We further looked at creating a loop to repeatedly split the dataset into training and testing sets, helping illustrate model performance variability under different random splits. This led to insights on the trade-off between model complexity and generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reinforce understanding, we then analyzed a code example with model7_gen1_predict_future, which aimed to fit a model on one subset (e.g., Generation 1 Pokémon) and evaluate it on another (non-Generation 1 Pokémon). This demonstrated how fitting a model on specific data can impact its predictive accuracy when applied to different data, revealing potential limitations of overfitting and model applicability to different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in preparation for a course project involving the Canadian Social Connection Survey data, we outlined a plan to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fit logistic regression models while interpreting them as if they were linear regressions for simplicity.\n",
    "Use the model summary to assess statistical significance and practical importance of each predictor variable.\n",
    "Visualize the effects of interaction terms between continuous and binary predictors using Plotly, simulating random noise to add realism to the plots.\n",
    "Overall, this conversation provided a robust walkthrough of regression analysis techniques, model interpretation, and strategies for understanding the complexities of interaction terms and generalization in statistical modeling.\""
