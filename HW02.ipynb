    "\"Summary of Monty Hall Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed a Python simulation of the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The player chooses one of three doors, behind one of which is a prize, and behind the other two are goats. After the player makes a choice, the host reveals a goat behind one of the remaining doors, and the player can then choose whether to stick with their original door or switch to the other unopened door.\n",
    "Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initial Code: The original code simulated this process 100,000 times, starting with the player always choosing door 1, then revealing a losing door, and switching to the remaining unopened door. The simulation tracked how often the player won by switching. It produced a result showing a win probability of around 66.6%, which matches the theoretical probability of winning by switching (2/3).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Code Simplification: To make the code more readable, we simplified it by using list comprehensions to handle door choices and filtering logic. The key lists in this simplified version are:\n",
    "        available_doors: This list stores the doors Monty can reveal, which are neither the player's initial choice nor the winning door.\n",
    "        remaining_door: This stores the last remaining door, which the player switches to after Monty reveals a losing door.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understanding the Lists:\n",
    "        available_doors: Filters out the player’s choice and the winning door, leaving only the doors Monty can reveal.\n",
    "        remaining_door: Filters out the player's initial choice and the revealed door, leaving the remaining door for the player to switch to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the simplified code was easier to understand and produced the same results, illustrating the power of switching doors in the Monty Hall problem.\" - ChatGPT https://chatgpt.com/share/66ec37ec-0d98-8007-a872-c82752ee8f0f"

    "4. \"We discussed a piece of Python code that contributes to the creation of a Markovian chatbot, which generates text by analyzing word sequences. The code uses two dictionaries: word_used, which tracks how often each word appears, and next_word, which records what words typically follow a given word and how often. The code iterates through a list of words (except the last one) to update these dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each iteration, it checks whether the current word has been encountered before and updates its frequency. Then it examines the next word in the sequence, incrementing its count as a possible follower of the current word or adding it if it’s new. This process builds a model of word transitions, which can later be used to generate new text by selecting words based on the probability of them following one another.\n",

    "    Initial Markovian Chatbot: You shared a piece of code that builds a Markov model by tracking word transitions from a list of words. I explained that the code is creating a frequency dictionary to track how often words appear and what words typically follow each other. I then provided a more efficient version using defaultdict to simplify the logic.\n",

I explained how the code creates character-specific Markov models, using nested dictionaries to store the data.\n",

Since beginning the course I have been able to use Chatbots in more practical ways and been exposed to many of the better aspects of Chatbots that I have not previously spent much time exploring. This shaped my perception from one of indifference as they were often not too helpful for what I tried to get it to do since they were more creative endeavours to now my perception is a bit more positive because it has been very helpful for explaining code and other more scientific ideas."

    "    Technical Skills: Knowledge of statistical concepts, data analysis, and proficiency in statistical software (e.g., R, SAS) and basic programming.\n",

    "    Soft Skills: Effective communication, collaboration, and project management skills.\n",
